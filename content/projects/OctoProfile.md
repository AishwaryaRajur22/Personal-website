Utilizing deep learning, the project employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and ResNet architectures to automate the analysis of radiographic images, enhancing accuracy and efficiency in identifying lung infections such as Covid-19, Pneumonia, and Lung opacity. The model, optimized with the Adam algorithm and ReLu activation function, achieves addressing the challenges of manual interpretation.
