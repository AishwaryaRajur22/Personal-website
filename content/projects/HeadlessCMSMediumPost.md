This project is a fault-tolerant, replicated key-value store ensuring data availability and causal consistency in distributed systems. It supports CRUD operations via a RESTful API, dynamic cluster management for seamless replica addition or removal, and is fully Dockerized for easy deployment and testing. A built-in test script verifies system functionality and consistency.
