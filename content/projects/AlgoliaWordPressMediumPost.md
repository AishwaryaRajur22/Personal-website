This project is a web-based dashboard built with Python, Flask, and PostgreSQL to visualize real-time bioreactor data. It allows users to plot and download data (temperature, pH, oxygen, pressure) as PNG images. The application dynamically fetches and displays time-series data from a PostgreSQL database for efficient data monitoring.
